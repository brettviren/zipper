#+title: Zipper is streaming priority merge queue

* Algorithms

- ~merged_queue~ :: a priority queue accepting elements from \(k\)
  ordered input streams to produce one ordered output stream.  The
  association of an element with its stream is maintained through the
  queue.  With it one may, for example, determine if the queue is
  "complete" such that it is safe to ~pop()~ the ~top()~ and not spoil
  subsequent ordering.

- ~tardy_queue~ :: a layer on ~merged_queue~ which limits latency and
  maintains ordering in the face of late arrival of input elements.
  It does this by discarding elements which are "tardy" on input.
